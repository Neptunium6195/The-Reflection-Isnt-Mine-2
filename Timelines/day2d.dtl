ellia: I must not look any further. Whatever occurs between her and her husband should not concern me.

ellia: The lady does have quite the eye.
ellia: These porcelains are the very ones the women in the city would not cease gushing over.

ellia: I doubt Sir Ludington is trapped in a mirror.
ellia: Of all things, a mirror! What nonsense.
ellia: Gentleman will say anything to keep a woman in the home. How crude!
# puts the book back down where it was

ellia: I am dreadfully fatigued. Am I to do all these tasks alone?
ellia: There must be another servant here. Though, I have not seen anyone but Mrs. Williams and the lady since my arrival.
ellia: I wonder if Charles is here at all.
ellia: Even the kitchens are empty when I eat. Perhaps the cook takes respite often.
ellia: I shall find out more tomorrow.
